# **Challenges (Questions to answer about our payroll data using awk to analyze)**

## **Easy (one-liners)**
1. How much money per hour does the janitor make?
2. What is the name of the CEO? Format like "LastName, FirstName"?
3. Which employees were hired on April 16, 1993? (Print the list)
4. Which employee works in the Springfield office?

## **A little harder**
5. How many mechanical engineers work here?
6. How many people from the Portwood family work here?
7. Are there any employees with identical first & last names? (IOW, the first name is the same as the last name. e.g. Linus Torvalds is not identical, Johnson Johnson is identical)

## **Gotta think a bit**
8. Print each column header, along with the column number. E.g. The LastName column is the second column, so print "2 - LastName"
9. How much money per hour does the Seattle office cost to run? (IOW, how much total per hour does it cost to pay all employees who work out of the Seattle office)
10. How many engineers (of any type) work here?
11. Who is the highest paid employee?
12. Who worked the most hours this week?

## **Awk proficient**
13. Anonymize the data by removing the first two columns. Print all remaining columns
14. Our client is complaining about the anonymized data from the previous question. They say is claiming it is too hard to read. They would like you to add line numbers to the beginning of each line in the output.
15. How many different office locations does the company have?
16. What is the average (mean) wage of all employees? What about the median (extra credit)?
17. Are there any duplicate entries? (Same names appearing on payroll more than once)
18. Who was the first employee hired?
